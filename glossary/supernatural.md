# Supernatural

If ability or effect is labelled as supernatural, it is something that is not
realistically possible in real world physics and biology. Supernatural features
generally relay on natural magical properties of the setting, but don't interact
with magic itself.

For example strength beyond limitations of human biology is supernatural. Magic
and different rules of nature allow for person to grow stronger than what they
could otherwise, but unlike when strength is enchanted with magical spell, they
still retain their strength when magic is not available, such as inside
anti-magic field.
