# Spell

Spell is a discrete magical ability or effect. As magical effects they are not
in effect while inside anti-magic field or another magic suppressing effect.

Spells are subject to many effect that only target them. Metamagic features can
only target spells, and counterspell can only counter spells.

Creature needs to have access to spellcasting feature to be able to cast spells,
but spells can also be stored into magic items and released from them.


Some features replicate effects of a spell, but these cases the ability and the
effect are supernatural or magical, and don't interact with rules of spells.
