# Attributes

Attributes are primary statistics of a creature in games using these rules.
Attributes are presented as a score and a modifier.

Attribute score is a number that tells how creature compares in sense of related
game mechanics to average human. Scores correspond to to humanity trough normal
distribution where expected value is 10.5 and standard deviation is roughly 3.
This means that range of 1 to 20 represents range that is naturally possible to
humans.

Attribute modifier is a number that is added rolls, when the attribute in
question is considered most important for success or failure in a given task.
As thus, it represents base line minimum ability of a creature to success in
a task without any task related training.

|  17   |   +3     |  1.29 % |      77 |  1.39 % |
|  18   |   +4     |  0.06 % |   1 666 |  0.46 % |
|  19   |   +4     | 0.003 % |  33 333 |  0.00 % |
|  20   |   +5     | 0.001 % | 100 000 |  0.00 % |

It should also be noted that the attribute score and modifier are not meant to
represent whole variety of human ability. People who are really good at
something, for example professional athletes, also have significant training in
whatever they are good at. Other features and proficiency bonus are meant to
convey this difference.
