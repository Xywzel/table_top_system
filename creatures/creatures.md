# Creatures

Core part of most tabletop roleplaying games is fighting monsters and every
fantasy, horror and sci-fi tale needs its weird creatures.

## Content of creature page

### Description

Description tells what the creature looks like and how it usually behaves.

Good description includes both a vague description that can be read out when the
creature is first sighted as well as clearer and fuller description that can be
used to answer players' questions and guide rulings where statblock fails short
of providing exact answer.

### Statblock

Statblock describes the gameplay statistics and features of creature. These are
full descriptions meant to be used while preparing sessions or needing to
resolve things that don't appear in every combat.

Statblock should be consistent internally and with the rest of the rules.

### Reference Card

Reference card is a minimalistic version of statblock, containing only parts of
the statblock that are relevant in every combat encounter. These are meant to
be printed or displayed from mobile device when running combat encounter. These
sometimes take shortcuts in their presentation. Boss creature with multiple
phases might have reference card for each of its phases, while some times
multiple variants of creature commonly appearing together might be described
in same card. Good reference card fits on a playing card sized paper with a
readable font size.

### Combat role and tactics

Combat role and tactics part explains how to use the creature in efficient and
interesting way.

Sometimes creature is meant to use tactic that is not necessarily self evident
from its statblock, and these instructions help running it to its full
potential.

Sometimes creature is modelled to use real world tactic, that due to simulation
accuracy is not as efficient than some other tactic allowed by its statblock,
and the tactics part allows instructing game masters to run creature without
too much meta-gaming and its intended power level.

### Loot

No fight against monster is complete without something to bring home as a price.
Loot part of creature page tells what kinds items creature might carry with it,
if it has valuable or useful gear or body parts

### Variants

Variants are a way to give more variety to a group of similar creatures, scale
them for fights on different tiers of play or make them fit into different
settings.
