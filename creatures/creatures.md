## Content of creature page

### Description

Description 

Good description includes both a vague description that can be read out when the
creature is first sighted.

### Statblock

Statblock describes the gameplay statistics and features of creature. These are
full descriptions meant to be used while preparing sessions or needing to
resolve things that don't appear in every combat.

### Reference Card

Reference card is a minimalistic version of statblock, containing only parts of
the statblock that are relevant in every combat encounter. These are meant to
be printed or displayed from mobile device when running combat encounter. These
sometimes take shortcuts in their presentation. Boss creature with multiple
phases might have reference card for each of its phases, while some times
multiple variants of creature commonly appearing together might be described
in same card. Good reference card fits on a playing card sized paper with a
readable font size.

settings.
