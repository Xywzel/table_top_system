# Gauntlets

Gauntlets are a environmental challenges run in combat turns. They represent
more complex challenges and hazards than individual traps. Gauntlets are an
alternative for a combat encounter in designing dungeons and quests, but they
offer less changes to utilize damage dealing abilities and are more dependent
on skill checks and utility spells.

Like combat, gauntlets benefit from having accurate visual presentation, such as
a map, for tracking characters positions and areas that threats cover.

## Designing a gauntlet

### Countdown
Countdown is a feature that means characters can't just wait or stand back
during the gauntlet. Countdown might be progressing threat, such as moving wall,
rising water level or spreading poison gas, that characters need to stay ahead
of. Countdown can also be secondary faction that can't reach the goal before the
players reach it or a exit that is slowly closing.

Purpose of countdown is to push players forward and keep them moving. It means
that they can't always wait for a safe phase to pass trough a threat and that
every successful and failed check is meaningful.

### Objective

Objective is what makes it necessary for players to interact with a gauntlet.

Survival is the most common and straight forward objective in any gauntlet. If
gauntlet is started surprisingly or from failed check with a trap, it might be
the only necessary objective, but having other objectives makes gauntlets more
interesting and engaging.



### Threats

#### Passive threats

Passive threats are the simplest of the threats. They are things that just exist
on the map and are hazardous only when characters are forced to interact with
them.

For example pit with spikes on the bottom is only a danger if character fails
an attempt to jump over it or is forcibly pushed into it. Passive threads are
generally easiest to avoid and can thus be extremely deathly.

Passive thread might have moving parts, a blade swinging back and forth from
chain with a frequency higher than 1 round trip per combat turn is still a
passive threat.

They don't generally need to be updated on the gauntlet update initiative, but
sometimes new passive threads might appear or old ones disappear as a part of
processing countdown or players interacting with the gauntlet.

For example, trapdoor over a acid pool is reactive trap, that leaves a passive
threat behind after being activated.

#### Moving threats

Moving threats are threats that move to new location on gauntlet update
initiative.

Moving thread generally moves along preset route, regardless of where players
are or what they are doing.

A axis of spinning blades on a trail, slowly moving wall of spikes and floating
orb releasing blast of electricity are moving threads.

When considering hazard area of moving thread, also consider where it will be
on its next turn. It might be necessary to extend the hazards area to cover
all points between its updates, or ask for a check to see if the character can
clear the space between the 

#### Active threats

Active threats are threats that act on gauntlet update initiative based on what
player characters are doing. Active threats are in many way similar to enemy
creatures in combat encounters.

#### Reactive threats

Reactive threats are like traps, they have a trigger condition and then take
effect immediately when the condition is fulfilled, usually during players turn.

Rules regarding design and use of traps should also be followed with reactive
threats, but they should be kept simpler.

Commonly reactive threats cause direct harm or advance countdown as a result of
failed skill check or when character moves to specific space.

## Running a gauntlet

Gauntlet starts when someone activates it. Usually this is one of the players,
who might step on a pressure plate, pull a lever or cross a magical barrier.
Gauntlet might also be started by someone else, villain observing party's
movements might activate the gauntlet when they think the party is far enough
inside or after finishing a villainous monologue.

When gauntlet starts, game moves into combat turns and initiative is rolled.
Players might have bonus or penalty to their initiative roll if they where
aware of the gauntlets activation or otherwise occupied. It is usually good
idea to use team initiative in gauntlets that only involve environmental
hazards and the player characters. Initiative count on which the gauntlet
updates is stated on its description, characters with higher initiative will
act before the first update, then the gauntlet will update and everyone can act.

This repeats until everyone had died or reached safety, or the gauntlet is
disabled.
