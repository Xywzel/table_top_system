# Maps

This folder contains maps for different purposes and more importantly, guides
to making useful maps and tools for using them.

## Battle map

Battle maps are maps meant for running tactical combat encounters. Good battle
map has some interesting tactical features, such as choke points, alternative
paths, cover and intractable objects. A good battle map will make 5th encounter
against 5 kobolts and a kobolt shaman feel fresh and different.

Good battle map is large enough, that most characters can't reach the other end
on their first turn, and that range of weapons and spells is meaningful, but
also small enough that it can fit on table in useable scale.

Battle maps come in 2 styles, abstract and defined.

### Abstract battle map

Abstract battle map is meant as template that one can fill to create actual
battle map. In them line might represent wall, fence or impassable hedge.
Intractable object might be a crossbow nailed to table, a ballistae or a magical
canon. Empty space between platforms might be lava, bottomless pit, rapid waters
or a magical hazard. While two battles fought one same abstract battle map might
have same tactical considerations, they can be flavoured very differently.

### Defined battle map

Defined battle map is a ready to use one, that tells the players exactly what
everything in it is. They are slightly less work to use, but don't fit as easily
into different settings.

## Scenario map

Scenario maps are build on same level of detail as battle maps, but cover larger
areas, usually including multiple battle encounter areas and connections between
them. They might also

## Room map

Room maps depict a single room in a very detailed level.

## Building map

Building map depicts an whole floor of a building, and often multiple floors
side by side. They might be filled to same level of detail as room maps, or just
have notes pointing to size and purpose of the room, so the user can select a
room that fits their purposes.
